/**
 * Plays a recorded round back as a [RawMouseSource]: every report is delivered when [clock] reaches
 * its recorded offset from the round start, restamped onto the replay's time. The recorded shots
 * (hits and misses) are available through [consumeShots] so the driver can fire them at the same
 * moments. Feeding this to a trainer with the recorded seed reproduces the round, which makes
 * recorded sessions regression fixtures. Call [anchor] right before the trainer starts its round.
