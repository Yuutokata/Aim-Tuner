/**
 * What the Raw Accel driver does to a stream of mouse reports, for the in-app simulation: the speed
 * of a report is its distance in inches (counts divided by the device [dpi]) over the time since the
 * previous report, clamped to Raw Accel's default limits (`rawaccel-base.hpp`: 1000 / 8000 / 2 ms to
 * 100 ms; `driver.cpp`: the first report after a pause sees the longest time), and the counts of the
 * report are multiplied by the curve's value at that speed. Carrying fractions into the next report
 * is not needed here, because the simulated view is continuous.
