 * median log ratio gives the wanted log gain there, and the whole is normalized so the median wanted
 * log gain over all movements is 0. The median, not the mean: the noise of a reach is about symmetric
 * in the error itself, so the mean of its logarithm is pulled down by an amount that grows with the
 * relative noise, which differs between slow, small reaches and fast, large ones; the mean therefore
 * invented a speed dependence for players who have none (docs/REVIEW.md M3): it says how the wanted gain changes with speed, not what the
 * sensitivity should be (that is the optimizer's job). See docs/ALGORITHMS.md ("Acceleration").
