 * One acceleration curve family with a single parameter, its strength: the gain at high hand speed
 * relative to low speed (1 = no curve, 1.2 = 20 % more sensitivity for fast movements, 0.8 = 20 % less).
 * The curve is Raw Accel's natural mode, which starts at gain 1 and levels off by itself; its decay is fixed.
 *
 * The strength is searched blind with the same optimizer that finds the sensitivity, over a pseudo
 * cm/360 of `100 * strength` (so the search is on a log scale and symmetric in rising and falling), instead
 * of being inferred from how first movements miss: that inference sees only a narrow band of hand speeds
 * (docs/ASSESSMENT.md, "Follow-up on a more precise curve").
