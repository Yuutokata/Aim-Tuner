/** The three output ratios of Raw Accel that an axis analysis can recommend. */
enum class AxisRatio { Y_X, L_R, U_D }

/**
 * Raw Accel's Y/X, L/R and U/D ratios from the length of first movements (docs/ALGORITHMS.md, "Passive setting analyses").
 *
 * For every direction (right, left, down, up) the gain G is how far the first movement went along that axis compared with how far
 * the target was: the weighted mean of `got / need` over the reaches whose target lies at least [MIN_COMPONENT_DEGREES] away along
 * that axis in that direction (ratio clipped to [[CLIP_LOW], [CLIP_HIGH]], weight `need^2`). The common undershoot of first
 * reaches is in every G and cancels in the ratios Raw Accel takes. The driver multiplies all vertical movement by Y/X, then upward movement by U/D and leftward movement
 * by L/R (`rawaccel.hpp:412-422`), so right and down are the directions no ratio touches: Y/X = G_right / G_down,
 * L/R = G_right / G_left, U/D = G_down / G_up (up multiplies by Y/X x U/D, so U/D is measured against down). A pure L/R or U/D
 * bias therefore does not move the Y/X estimate.
 *
 * Thresholds, fixed before the gate ran: at least [MIN_PER_SIDE] reaches on each side; interval = 95 % bootstrap of the ratio;
 * recommend only if the interval excludes 1 and the change is at least [MIN_CHANGE]; value rounded to 0.01.
