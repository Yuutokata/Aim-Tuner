/**
 * The speed dependence of the wanted gain from normal and speed rounds (docs/ALGORITHMS.md, "Speed rounds").
 *
 * In normal rounds the speed of a reach is almost fixed by its distance (corr 0.956 in the simulation), so an error that
 * depends on the distance (a range effect: short reaches overshoot, long ones fall short) cannot be told from a gain that
 * depends on the speed. In a speed round the targets vanish quickly and the hand moves the same distances faster. Within
 * one distance bin the two kinds of round then differ in speed but not in distance, and the change of the median error
 * between them over the change of the median log speed is the slope of the wanted log gain against log speed. Every bin
 * has its own level, so any effect of the distance alone drops out. Bins are compared by their medians: the noise of a
 * rushed reach is larger, and a mean of the log error would sink with it (the M3 artefact of docs/REVIEW.md). The speed
 * of a single reach is not used as such; it carries the reach's own noise (E1 of docs/OPTIMIZER-REVIEW.md).
 *
 * What it cannot see: a hand that undershoots more when rushed, whatever the gain, looks like a wish for more gain at
 * speed. The blind test stays the judge.
